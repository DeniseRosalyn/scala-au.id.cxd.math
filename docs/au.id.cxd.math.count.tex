\subsection{package au.id.cxd.math.count}

The count package contains a series of modules dedicated to methods of counting.

\subsubsection{Factorial}

The factorial operation is provided as $n!$ implementing:
$$
\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i)
$$
The Factorial implementation will memoize results, allowing for efficient reuse during runtime. 

\subsubsection{Choose}

The choose module implements $n \choose m$, how many ways can m items be selected with replacement from a set of n items. \\
Determined as:
$$
\frac{n!}{m!n!}
$$

\subsubsection{Permutation}

The method of selecting m ordered items from a set of n ordered items $P {n \choose m}$.\\
$$
\frac{n!}{(n-m)!}
$$
