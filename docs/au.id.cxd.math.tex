\section{Overview}

This library implements a number of functions for mathematical operations, it has dependencies upon the scala-nlp-breeze matrix library, and its purpose is to explore the implementation of various mathematical functions.
This document is structured with the main headings corresponding to the subject areas implemented in the library, and minor headings corresponding to the major package names in the project. Each subsection below the minor headings is also decomposed into individual subject areas, and the lowest level heading represents a class.

\section{Probability}

\subsection{package au.id.cxd.math.probability}

This package provides a series of modules that support operations for inference via probability, and for estimation of distributions.

\subsubsection{Inequalities}

The class TchebysheffInequality implements a simple estimation of a pdf using the inequality rule:\\
$$
P(\mu - k\sigma < Y < \mu + k\sigma) \ge 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}
$$
Which can be restated as:
$$
P(lower < Y < upper) \ge 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}
$$
The value of $k$ is derived from either upper and lower bounds since:
$$
k = \frac{upper - \mu} {\sigma}
$$
After determining the value of $k$ the probability can be estimated by substituting
$$
p = 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}
$$
