        </h3>

        <p>This library is a hobby project, and is only occasionally worked on. It serves several purposes for me.

        <ul>
            <li>To gradually document a variety of ideas I'm learning in relation to probability and statistics.</li>
            <li>To provide a sandpit to experiment with those ideas and to get to grips with the mathematics behind
                those ideas.
            </li>
            <li>To experiment with implementing those ideas in a software library form.</li>
        </ul>
        Part of this is experimenting with library design, or to simply attempt an implementation of an algorithm
        in order to get to grips with the mechanics behind it.

        Alot of it is reading, reading other material, attempting to unravel and capture some form of it.

        Occasionally (god forbid) there may even result some practical applications of these
        ideas, if that occurs then an example may be produced or a test case would currently serve as an example.

        <p>
            I'm not running sprints in this project, it's a hobby, a sandpit away from daily software production process I'm normally involved with (otherwise known as work).

            I might use it for an assignment occasionally, I might even take bits and pieces of it for real work on occasion.

            However, there already exists plenty of proven libraries that already support functions and algorithms in this domain,
            and there are already plenty of good languages for this purpose as well. So have a look around for those instead.

        <p>
            Disclosures aside, I'm also looking to find a reasonable way to write the library in a literate manner, I've partially begun with a latex
            form of documentation, but finding that to be entirely separate from the code itself, whilst a suitable form for notating the math, somewhat
            cumbersome to maintain separately. So I've fallen back to using the scaladoc system to record information about the principles behind each of the classes
            embedded in the classes themselves. An sbt task is used to substitute a token for the mathjax CDN and this allows for math notation to be included
            within the scala documentation, however it is reasonably limited in comparison to what latex can do with the notation, so in many cases, it takes several iterations
            to get the notation to render. For the time being, that seems like a practical approach to notating the library, in the long run I think I'll work
            between the two approaches, as I do prefer the latex notation over the scaladoc.
