scala-au.id.cxd.math
====================

Libraries containing math related functions in scala. 

Provides probability distributions (similar to Breeze), and other utilities for analysis.

Further details are available at the "github pages" branch for the project located at:

[au.id.cxd.math](http://cxd.github.io/scala-au.id.cxd.math/)


### A library experimenting with statistics.

This library is a hobby project, and is only occasionally worked on. It serves several purposes for me.

 - To gradually document a variety of ideas I'm learning in relation to probability and statistics.
 
 - To provide a sandpit to experiment with those ideas and to get to grips with the mathematics behind those ideas.
 
 - To experiment with implementing those ideas in a software library form.

Part of this is experimenting with library design, or to simply attempt an implementation of an algorithm in order to get to grips with the mechanics behind it. Alot of it is reading, reading other material, attempting to unravel and capture some form of it. 

 The library will change over time, and progress will be limited by other activities. This library is not intended as a stable production library, and is experimental in nature.

### Documentation.

The documentation consists both of [API documentation](http://cxd.github.io/scala-au.id.cxd.math/latest/math/api/index.html) and some of this information is extracted into separate notes and examples.
